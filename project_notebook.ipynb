        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "This study explores the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying Yelp customer reviews into 1-5 star ratings. We evaluate distinct prompting strategies to determine the optimal balance between accuracy, JSON validity, and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Prompt Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "### V1: The Baseline\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: 57%\n",
        "- **Status**: Reliable but lacks nuance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### V2: Deep Chain-of-Thought (Original)\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: 30% (Failed)\n",
        "- **Status**: **Unstable**. The complex free-text reasoning requirement caused massive JSON syntax failures (56% invalid).\n",
        "\n",
        "### V3: Real-World Few-Shot\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: 67%\n",
        "- **Status**: **Top Performer**. High reliability and strong performance on nuance.\n",

        "- **Accuracy**: 64%\n",
        "- **JSON Validity**: 100%\n",
        "- **Notes**: While this strategy fixed the parsing errors completely, it slightly underperformed the Few-Shot strategy (67%).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. What Changed? (V2 Original vs. V2 Improved)\n",
        "To fix the 56% failure rate of the original CoT prompt, we made three key structural changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Implicit Reasoning**: Instead of asking the model to output a long `\"analysis\"` paragraph (which often contained unescaped newlines and quotes), we instructed it to perform \"Internal reasoning steps\" and output only a brief explanation.\n",
        "2.  **Strict JSON Constraints**: Added explicit rules: *\"Output ONLY valid JSON\"*, *\"No line breaks inside strings\"*, and *\"Explanation must be brief\"*.\n",
        "3.  **Simplified Schema**: Renamed keys to `predicted_stars` and `explanation` to clearly separate the prediction from the reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Comparison Table (N=200)\n",
        "\n",
        "| Strategy | Accuracy | JSON Validity | Count | Notes |\n",

        "For the Yelp dataset using Llama 3.1 8B:\n",
        "1.  **Real-World Few-Shot (V3)** is the recommended strategy (67% accuracy).\n",
        "2.  **Structured CoT (V2 Improved)** is a strong alternative (64% accuracy) if you need the model to explain its reasoning, as it now guarantees valid JSON output."
